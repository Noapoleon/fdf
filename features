- executable arguments that dont care about order
- keybindings menu (maybe allow changing the keybinding)
- projection type menu (cycle with p)
- state machine ? (not really)
- make something to simplify function calls (both their names and parameters)
- logging system (embeded into struct or something)
- map selector menu
- rething s_nlgw to include the map and maybe call it something else
- when doing colored lines. only do gradient computations if both sides or not
  the same color
- handle empty maps (THERE'S A LOT TO DO WITH THE PARSER AND FORMAT)

IMP:
	- MAKEFILE doesn't work well. (obj dir non existant and fails to find clean rule or something)
	- include minilibx sources and libft sources in repo without .git dir
